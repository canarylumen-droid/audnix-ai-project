### How It Works

1. **Intelligent Comment Analysis** - AI reads EVERY comment to detect:
   - Questions ("how?", "what is this?")
   - Excitement ("wow!", "amazing!")
   - Curiosity ("tell me more")
   - ANY positive engagement
   - Emoji signals (🔥, 😍, 👀, 💯)
   - Friend tags (shows sharing/interest)

2. **Context-Aware DM Generation**:
   ```
   Comment: "How does this work?"

   DM: "Hey @username, you asked how this works - let me show you 
   exactly what this does and how it can help you [their specific need]"
   ```

3. **Smart Follow-Up** - If they engage:
   - Voice message for warm leads (15s max)
   - Professional follow request after conversion
   - Handles objections intelligently

```
User: "This is cool!"

```

**Audnix AI:**
```
User: "This is cool!"
AI: "Hey Sarah, glad you're excited! This is exactly what you 
need if you want to [detected need]. Let me show you how..."

User: "wow this is exactly what I need"
AI: "Hey Sarah, I love that energy! Since you're ready, here's
