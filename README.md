### How It Works

1. **Intelligent Comment Analysis** - AI reads EVERY comment to detect:
   - Questions ("how?", "what is this?")
   - Excitement ("wow!", "amazing!")
   - Curiosity ("tell me more")
   - ANY positive engagement
   - Emoji signals (🔥, 😍, 👀, 💯)
   - Friend tags (shows sharing/interest)

2. **Context-Aware DM Generation**:

   Comment: "How does this work?"

   AI analyzes: They want to understand the mechanism

   DM: "Hey @username, you asked how this works - let me show you 
   exactly what this does and how it can help you [their specific need]"
   ```

3. **Smart Follow-Up** - If they engage:
   - Voice message for warm leads (15s max)
   - Professional follow request after conversion
   - Handles objections intelligently

### Example Flows

**Traditional ManyChat:**
```
User: "This is cool!"
Bot: *no response* (not a keyword)

User: "link"
Bot: "Here's the link!" (generic template)
```

**Audnix AI:**
```
User: "This is cool!"
AI: "Hey Sarah, glad you're excited! This is exactly what you 
need if you want to [detected need]. Let me show you how..."

User: "wow this is exactly what I need"
AI: "Hey Sarah, I love that energy! Since you're ready, here's

## 🔔 Stripe Webhooks Setup (When You're Ready)

**Current Status: ✅ Not needed yet - Payment links work without webhooks**

You can safely skip webhooks for the first month. Payment links handle:
- ✅ Initial purchases (subscriptions + top-ups)
- ✅ User upgrades immediately after payment
- ✅ Payment confirmations

### When to Add Webhooks

Add webhooks when you need:
- **Monthly subscription renewals** - Auto-charge users each month
- **Failed payment handling** - Downgrade users who don't pay
- **Cancellation management** - Handle subscription cancellations
- **Refund processing** - Automatically update user access on refunds

### Setup Instructions (5 Minutes)

1. **Create Webhook Endpoint in Stripe Dashboard**
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Click **+ Add endpoint**
   - Enter URL: `https://your-app.repl.co/api/billing/webhook`
   - Select events:
     - `checkout.session.completed` - Payment success
     - `customer.subscription.updated` - Plan changes
     - `customer.subscription.deleted` - Cancellations
     - `invoice.payment_failed` - Failed payments
     - `charge.refunded` - Refunds

2. **Copy Webhook Secret**
   - After creating endpoint, click **Reveal** next to "Signing secret"
   - Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_...`)

3. **Add to Replit Secrets**
   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
   ```

4. **Restart your app** - Webhook handler will activate automatically

### What Each Event Does

**`checkout.session.completed`**
- Upgrades user plan immediately
- Adds top-up minutes to balance
- Creates payment record
- Sends success notification

**`customer.subscription.updated`**
- Syncs plan changes (upgrades/downgrades)
- Updates billing period
- Handles status changes (active → past_due)

**`customer.subscription.deleted`**
- Downgrades to trial plan
- Grants 14-day grace period
- Sends cancellation notification

**`invoice.payment_failed`**
- Sends payment failure notification
- Prompts user to update payment method
- Auto-downgrade after 3 failed attempts (optional)

**`charge.refunded`**
- Reverts plan downgrade (if refunded within 7 days)
- Restores voice minutes for top-up refunds
- Creates refund notification

### Handling Refunds Manually (Before Webhooks)

If a customer requests a refund before you have webhooks:

1. **Process refund in Stripe Dashboard**
   - Go to Payments → Click payment
   - Click **Refund** button
   - Enter refund amount

2. **Manually downgrade user in your database**
   ```sql
   -- Find user by email
   SELECT id, plan FROM users WHERE email = 'customer@example.com';
   
   -- Downgrade to trial
   UPDATE users 
   SET plan = 'trial', 
       stripe_subscription_id = NULL,
       trial_expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '14 days'
   WHERE id = 'user_id_here';
   
   -- Remove top-up minutes (if top-up refund)
   UPDATE users 
   SET voice_minutes_topup = voice_minutes_topup - 100
   WHERE id = 'user_id_here';
   ```

3. **Send manual email**
   - Subject: "Refund Processed - Trial Extended"
   - Message: "Your refund of $X.XX has been processed. We've extended your trial by 14 days."

### Handling Downgrades Manually

If user cancels subscription before webhooks are setup:

1. **Check for cancellation in Stripe Dashboard**
   - Go to Subscriptions → Search customer email
   - Look for "Canceled" status

2. **Manually downgrade in database**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users 
   SET plan = 'trial',
       stripe_subscription_id = NULL,
       trial_expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '14 days'
   WHERE email = 'customer@example.com';
   ```

### Testing Webhooks (Use Stripe CLI)

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
npm install -g stripe

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/api/billing/webhook

# Trigger test events
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted
stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
```

### Webhook Code Location

The webhook handler is already implemented in:
- **File:** `server/routes/webhook.ts`
- **Route:** `/api/billing/webhook`
- **Method:** POST
- **Status:** ✅ Production-ready (just add webhook secret)

**Built with React, Express, PostgreSQL, Supabase, OpenAI, and Meta APIs** | **Ready to deploy on Replit in minutes** 🚀
