/**
 * AUTONOMOUS OBJECTION RESPONDER
 * =============================
 * When a lead says "no", "maybe", "let me think", etc.
 * AI autonomously generates closing response (not just suggestions)
 * 
 * Turns EVERY objection into a sales opportunity
 * - "Let me think about it" → "Here's why you shouldn't wait..."
 * - "Too expensive" → "One deal pays for this all year..."
 * - "I need to talk to my partner" → "Let's get them on a call..."
 * 
 * NO MORE REJECTIONS - ONLY NEGOTIATIONS

3. Use ONE short story from above (2 sentences max)
4. Ask ONE powerful closing question
5. End with assumed action ("Let's set this up" not "Would you?")

8. NO apologies, NO "I understand" - be direct
