# Audnix AI - Production-Ready Multi-Channel Sales Automation SaaS

### Overview
Audnix AI is a premium, zero-setup multi-channel sales automation SaaS platform designed for creators, coaches, agencies, and founders. It automates lead imports from WhatsApp, Email (custom SMTP), and CSV, then intelligently follows up with personalized campaigns across 24/7 workers. The platform emphasizes privacy by connecting directly to users' own business email, Calendly accounts, and WhatsApp, avoiding Audnix API dependencies. Key capabilities include real-time progress tracking, AI-powered email filtering, day-aware campaign automation (Day 1, 2, 5, 7), OTP email authentication, and Stripe billing with a 3-day free trial. The project is currently production-ready with zero errors, clean TypeScript build, and all core features operational, prepared for Vercel deployment.
