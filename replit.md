## 🆕 NEW FEATURES (Version 2.2)

### 1. AI Legal Disclaimers ✅
**What it does:** Auto-prepends legal disclaimers to all AI messages WITHOUT alerting leads
- **Auto-disclaimer:** Every AI message (email, WhatsApp, SMS, voice) includes disclaimer
- **Placement:** Hidden in message body (leads don't see system notifications)
- **Legally Sound:** Protects company from liability by stating AI messages aren't binding
- **Lead-Friendly:** Doesn't scare leads - disclaimer is blended naturally

**Example:**
```
[Your real message content here...]

[Automated message from Audnix - This message was generated by AI. For official policies, 
please refer to our Terms of Service at audnixai.com/terms]
```

### 2. Updated Terms of Service ✅
**New Section 13: "AI-Generated Communications Disclaimer"**
- ✅ Explains AI messages are NOT legally binding
- ✅ Makes clear only authorized reps can make commitments
- ✅ Details user responsibility for message content
- ✅ Special rules for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, legal)

**Key Point:** Clear liability chain - company responsible, user responsible, recipient knows it's AI

### 3. Updated Privacy Policy ✅
**New Section: "AI-Generated Message Data Processing"**
- ✅ What data we use for AI generation
- ✅ How AI training works (opt-in, not default)
- ✅ User responsibility for lead consent
- ✅ Data retention & deletion policies

---

## 🎯 LEGAL PROTECTION STRATEGY

### For Your Company
```
✅ Disclaimer in every message (audit trail proves we warned users)
✅ Terms of Service explicitly states AI limitations
✅ Privacy Policy discloses AI data processing
✅ Audit trail logs every disclaimer sent
✅ Not liable for user-generated content violations
```

### For Your Leads (No Alarm Bells)
```
✅ Disclaimer blends into message naturally
✅ No "This is AI" popup that scares them off
✅ Helps leads understand to verify important info
✅ Builds trust through transparency
```

### For Regulated Industries
```
⚠️ Users must get approval before using AI for regulated comms
⚠️ Terms warn about finance/healthcare/legal restrictions
⚠️ Users can add "human review" option before send
```

## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS (Behind the Scenes)

### Step 1: Generate Message
```typescript
const aiReply = await generateFollowUp(...);
// Returns: "Hi John, we'd love to discuss your needs..."
```

### Step 2: Add Disclaimer
```typescript
const { messageWithDisclaimer } = prependDisclaimerToMessage(
  aiReply,
  'email',
  'Your Company'
);
// Returns: "[AI message] ... [Disclaimer at bottom]"
```

### Step 3: Send to Lead
```typescript
await sendMessage(userId, lead, messageWithDisclaimer, 'email');
// Leads receive: Full message with disclaimer embedded
// They don't see: "This is an AI message" system notification
```

### Step 4: Log Compliance
```typescript
await AuditTrailService.logAiMessageSent(...);
// Recorded: Disclaimer was included, when, to whom, via which channel
// Protected: You have proof you warned them
```
