## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS (Behind the Scenes)

### Step 1: Generate Message
```typescript
const aiReply = await generateFollowUp(...);
// Returns: "Hi John, we'd love to discuss your needs..."
```

### Step 2: Add Disclaimer
```typescript
const { messageWithDisclaimer } = prependDisclaimerToMessage(
  aiReply,
  'email',
  'Your Company'
);
// Returns: "[AI message] ... [Disclaimer at bottom]"
```

### Step 3: Send to Lead
```typescript
await sendMessage(userId, lead, messageWithDisclaimer, 'email');
// Leads receive: Full message with disclaimer embedded
// They don't see: "This is an AI message" system notification
```

### Step 4: Log Compliance
```typescript
await AuditTrailService.logAiMessageSent(...);
// Recorded: Disclaimer was included, when, to whom, via which channel
// Protected: You have proof you warned them
```
