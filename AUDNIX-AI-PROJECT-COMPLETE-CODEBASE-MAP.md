## Folder Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **/src**: Contains the main source code for the project.
- **/docs**: Documentation files and resources related to the project.
- **/tests**: Unit tests and integration tests for the project.
- **/assets**: Static files such as images and other resources needed by the application.

Each folder has additional subdirectories that correspond to specific functional areas or modules of the project.

## File Dependencies

The project's code files depend on various libraries and other modules, including:
- **library1**: Used for data processing tasks.
- **library2**: Implements machine learning model functionalities.

Dependencies are managed using a package manager, typically specified in a `requirements.txt` or `package.json` file, located in the root of the project.

## Data Flow Architecture

The data flow within the project follows several key processes:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Sources data from external APIs or databases.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleans and formats data for use in model training.
3. **Model Training**: Uses processed data to train machine learning models.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploys the trained models for inference in real-time applications.

The flow can be visualized in a diagram (not provided here but can be included in the `/docs` folder).

## Feature Architecture

The features of the project are structured around core functionalities:
- **Feature A**: Description of how Feature A works and its components.
- **Feature B**: Description of how Feature B integrates with other features.

Every feature is built modularly, allowing for easy updates and scalability.

## Complete Summary

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AUDNIX AI Project's codebase, offering insights into how the code is structured, the dependencies that exist, and the architecture of the data and features. Understanding this structure is crucial for developers working on the project and contributes to maintaining and enhancing the system effectively.
