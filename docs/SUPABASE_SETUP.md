# Supabase Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up your Supabase database for Audnix AI in production.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (free tier works great to start)
- Your Supabase project created at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

## Step 1: Get Your Credentials

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click the **Settings** icon (gear) in the sidebar
3. Navigate to **API** section
4. Copy these three values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...  # Public/anon key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...      # Service role key (keep secure!)
```

5. Add these to your Replit Secrets or `.env` file

## Step 2: Enable Required Extensions

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Database** â†’ **Extensions**
2. Search for and enable:
   - `pgvector` (for AI embeddings)
   - `uuid-ossp` (for UUID generation)

## Step 3: Run Database Migrations

You have two options for running migrations:

### Option A: SQL Editor (Recommended)

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `migrations/002_audnix_schema.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the migration
5. Repeat with `migrations/003_production_upgrade.sql`

### Option B: Supabase CLI

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref

# Run migrations
supabase db push
```

## Step 4: Verify Installation

After running the migrations, verify everything is set up correctly:

1. Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
2. You should see these tables:
   - âœ… users
   - âœ… leads
   - âœ… messages
   - âœ… integrations
   - âœ… followup_jobs
   - âœ… automations
   - âœ… oauth_tokens
   - âœ… brand_embeddings
   - âœ… semantic_memory
   - âœ… and more...

3. Check that Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled:
   - Click on any table â†’ **...** menu â†’ **View Policies**
   - You should see policies like "Users can view own data"

## Step 5: Test the Connection

1. Add your credentials to Replit Secrets or `.env`
2. Restart your application
3. Check the console logs - you should see:
   ```
   âœ“ Using Supabase storage (production mode)
   ```
   Instead of:
   ```
   âš  Using MemStorage (development mode)
   ```

## Step 6: Create Your First User

After authentication is working, your first user will be created automatically when they sign in via OAuth. The OAuth callback at `/api/auth/callback` handles:

1. Exchanging the OAuth code for a session
2. Extracting user metadata (name, email, avatar)
3. Creating or updating the user in your `users` table
4. Starting a 3-day trial automatically

## Row Level Security (RLS)

The migrations automatically set up RLS policies so users can only access their own data:

- Users can only see their own profile
- Users can only access their own leads, messages, and integrations
- Admin users have elevated permissions
- Service role key bypasses RLS for backend operations

## Common Issues

### Issue: "relation 'users' does not exist"
**Solution**: You haven't run the migrations yet. Go to Step 3.

### Issue: "permission denied for table users"
**Solution**: You're using the anon key instead of service role key on the backend. Check your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

### Issue: "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Solution**: Make sure you're using the service role key for backend operations, not the anon key.

### Issue: Vector extension errors
**Solution**: Enable the `pgvector` extension in Database â†’ Extensions.

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables

**users**: User accounts with plan, trial, and billing info
- Linked to Supabase Auth via `supabase_id`
- Tracks plan tier, trial expiry, Stripe IDs
- Stores user preferences (timezone, reply tone)

**leads**: Contacts from Instagram/WhatsApp/Email
- Belongs to a user
- Tracks status, score, channel, tags
- Stores contact info and metadata

**messages**: Conversation history
- Links to both lead and user
- Supports text and voice messages
- Tracks direction (inbound/outbound)

**integrations**: Connected provider accounts
- Stores encrypted OAuth tokens
- Tracks connection status and type
- One integration per provider per user

### Advanced Tables

**followup_jobs**: Automated follow-up queue
- Scheduled messages for leads
- Retry logic and error tracking
- Channel-specific parameters

**brand_embeddings** & **semantic_memory**: AI knowledge base
- Vector embeddings for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Enables AI to remember brand info and past conversations
- Uses pgvector for similarity search

**oauth_tokens**: Provider access/refresh tokens
- Manages token lifecycle
- Automatic refresh handling
- Encrypted storage

## Next Steps

After your database is set up:

1. âœ… Set up Supabase Auth OAuth providers (Google, Apple)
2. âœ… Configure Stripe for billing
3. âœ… Set up OpenAI for AI features
4. âœ… Configure email provider (optional)
5. âœ… Set up provider OAuth (Instagram, WhatsApp, Gmail)

See the main `.env.example` file for all required environment variables.

## Backup and Monitoring

### Automated Backups
Supabase automatically backs up your database daily on all plans. You can:
- View backups in **Database** â†’ **Backups**
- Restore from a backup with one click
- Download backups for local storage

### Monitoring
Monitor your database health in **Database** â†’ **Reports**:
- Query performance
- Connection pool usage  
- Storage usage
- Slow query log

## Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] All migrations run successfully
- [ ] RLS policies tested and working
- [ ] Backup schedule verified
- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] Service role key kept secure (never exposed to frontend)
- [ ] Connection pooling enabled for high traffic
- [ ] Indexes created for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Vector indexes built for embeddings (automatic with migration)

## Support

If you run into issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in **Database** â†’ **Logs**
2. Review RLS policies if you get permission errors
3. Verify all extensions are enabled
4. Check the Supabase Discord or documentation

Your Audnix AI database is now production-ready! ðŸš€
