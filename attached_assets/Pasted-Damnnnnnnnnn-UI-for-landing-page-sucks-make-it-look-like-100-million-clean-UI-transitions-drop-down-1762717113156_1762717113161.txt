Damnnnnnnnnn UI for landing page sucks make it look like $100 million clean UI transitions drop down gover effects even on pricing add some clean UI cards with clean drop down lighting up hover effect clean smooth responsive on mobile even the text too and on any devices improve it properly make it convert them convince them look more engaging to play around with too button to fit match mobile view desktop view padding everything reduce hyphens bullet points look professional UI to talk more each section to be good and perfect even hero section brief instead after the CTA add it or make it more brief no long talksfew wordings they understand the entire AI sales closer or rep in cards cleannui maybe add drop-down to add a brief explanation of it not syart listing features pain point our solution their problems done use audnixai.com that's it and supabase auth isn't working is there any simpler version maybe firebase if simpler and won't spoil anything in our code should we use it if lots of work will be done suggest best idea maybe use it for auth then see login info in supabase like should my friend deploy now let's see new changes it auto builds but didn't work so and update what's left check current stats add what's not properly done and make sure human timing follow up in few hours works learns from brand pdf comment video automation works i know that alone will kill manychat and even in 2 to 3 days before trial ends creators must make money and revenue see some conversion full results clear testimonials not small or say maybe pro will have more time to convert no even free trials make money and making money online make content automate follow up import automate make money and deals wake up to booked calls close it sleep in deal tab see analysis of deals and know how much you made too
Now we can launch even from scratch blow up as a 16 year old founder of the brand even tell me realistic amount we can get in week one no fluff with daily making of content and should it be twice a day etc
If firebase is better we use it authenticate no complex stuff tell me what to add in vercel env that's it go to the console then no client id right
If it's better won't spoil lots of works errors or database then change it sdk just tell me what to do
But confirm first
And lastly check all database it'll surely be created automatically payment everything works finally now env to be updated based on current project features once not needed or completed or not valid again
And this landing page saying Instagram coming soon too much just explain everything even the comment automation properly a card drop down UI smooth
Then only say it in pricing for paid users coming soon
And hover on each pricing good click UI too etc
Finalize everything powerful enough like a pro deal closer
