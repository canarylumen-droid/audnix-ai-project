The project is facing complex production deployment issues including a broken landing page, missing assets, 'Mail is not defined' errors, and non-functional notification sounds. These require deep architectural investigation, asset resolution, and cross-file debugging that are beyond the scope of Quick Edit mode. Switching to Autonomous mode will allow me to systematically solve these interconnected issues.
