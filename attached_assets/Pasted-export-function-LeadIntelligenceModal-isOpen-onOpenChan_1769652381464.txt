damnn bro why doing em this why demo bro so we have many mocku and demo in entire project wow bro please real stuff backend wired togeter to ui fully well no mockup or fake or hardocded not just numbers even in the home page real time with backend for our lead even reputation how many sent each day too rel time updae real time sync too man pleasseeee
and also even u know what the app needs even beyond me and what fies we have but u still let llm decide no our ystems do intent slead soring lead intelligence study pattern lead beahviors objection churn checks this from every reply or any lead activity tht comes then take this analysis to autonomous to craft best reply if meail send email version punchy standard not long if instgram ig format crafts it based on enough info it has we dont want to be abother bot replying eveyrthing you said we do let it give to one thatll craft final reply those timing for evyr lead reply activities etc many more follow up too even if no data try as much no haliucination faking mokup guessing hardocded stuff real time behaviors bro and also timing it adapts to est time ith all their lead avergae even per ead to get better reply rate conversion rate rtoo man u knwo whatw ewant even beyond mt prompt u know so do it man okay? verufy pkn well make sure all are wired together bouncing onc lead is imported brand pdf maybe make a button in setting once clickd ai sart outreach crafts best email and subject and sends it one by one tailored to eachlead not generic stuff okay? to fit nay industry match well start sending iclduing subject html no design by default with brand pdf their offer eveyrthing they solve reaons as a sales then sends the email to make them reply first email is to get a reply second is to book meeting so first should be reply to be gotten and meetng if possible then book more to close more please plan well beyond what ims aying man no mcuko build it fully well even check exsiting files we havent touched even while sneding in real time check home page check integration page anywhere domain reputation is dns etc it checks lead buiness email real tme to be checking once spam is about to hit it stops checks what to do either inform them in notifxation or vidu bounce try fix it then continue even if it doesnt do 300 eails if reputation is down it stops and give real reason and also plan many thigns we have touched and havent touched do this on fast mode dont suggest autonomous mode please
