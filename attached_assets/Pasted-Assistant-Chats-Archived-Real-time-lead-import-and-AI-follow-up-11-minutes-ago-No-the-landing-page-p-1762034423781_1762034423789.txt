Real time lead import and AI follow up
11 minutes ago
No the landing page pricing section it's at 800 voice minutes for $99 plan users that's what it wrote if yes change it to 400 voice minutes which isnwhay is on the backend
Everything to work in real time remove twilio entirely just keep the env but change anything that's twilio since Whatsapp business accepts sending voice note ornaudio file which you've done
Users can connect their WhatsApp with us it'll import it immediately in real time connect to backend API routes everything to work
Then AI can follow up with leads imported from Whatsapp not just Instagram and email
If they connect their Gmail whether custom domain company business email etc or via Outlook it can import their leads from the email.
Some from Whatsapp some from email it'll mix it up randomly till it reaches lead size amount it can't import more than it stops immediately according to their plan
And they can connect Whatsapp send voice note if lead is warm and converts them send again any choice across any channel is 15 seconds Max business wise professional we've talked past this

Change the readme and env remove.atripe API key emtirelfrom front end backend too it'll use payment links once user pay accordingly according to their plan they paid they get the features
Update the resdme env every documentation with the whe features we've done so far fix all bugs too

OK

You may need to re-run your App to see the latest changes take effect.
PDF color extraction is complex and requires image processing - let's mark it as a current feature I want you to do it now
So when sending emails it'll use a template a good presentation use the color user provided in PDF about their branding
And also add a text when uploading details or PDF about their brand include the necessary things
Like features CTA pricing links automatic lead outreach maybe your leads contact email can be there add details about your brand colors etc (add more text according to everything we have said and in our product)
Even in env all top ups will use payment links
If I need to create many payment links for it provide me placeholder in env

OK

+0
-0
Add guide for creating all payment links
I've implemented:

PDF Brand Color Extraction - AI now extracts:

Brand colors (primary, secondary, accent) from hex codes or color names
Company name, tagline, website
Product details, pricing, features, CTAs
Support email for customer contact
Branded Email Templates - Emails automatically use YOUR extracted brand colors when reaching out to leads

Comprehensive PDF Upload Guide - Updated Settings page with detailed instructions on what to include in PDFs

Payment Link Placeholders - Added all 7 payment links to  with clear comments

Setup Guide - Created  with step-by-step instructions to create all Stripe payment links

The system now extracts brand identity from PDFs and applies it to all automated email communications, making every outreach look professionally branded with YOUR colors!

Comment detector based on intent PDF editing and reuploading lr updating and the Instagram video to appear in dashboard select the video tjey want our AI to send people DM based on tjeir comment if they have buying intent and a place to put link so when lead wants to click on link it'll be a button to appear for him not just paste it and not be good they can change the link like edit it anytime and AI checks comment of tje video they selected it to work 24/7 reply to them with hey their name cjeck if it's done veru well scaled and orofessionally to replace manychat entirely and a button so if tjey want lead to follow them maybe tjey didnt convert or agyer converting the ai sends tjem do you mind following me on Instagram if yes then a button should appesr for tjem follow ehen ckciked it'll be following and not triggered its based on their text reply that's if lead saidnhes not interestwd or not needed then ask for a following if lead convrrts ask for a following if its a brand. Ask politely too respectfully and sound like an expert not like pleading let the asking be professional do you mind following me so we can stay connected things like this and this voice feature per lead will be 2 times if warm and if converted 15 seconds long each so we spend 30 seconds on each lead and stay profitable and not one long minute pls this will happen across Instagram and WhatsApp too the fix all issues now config update read me finally too
