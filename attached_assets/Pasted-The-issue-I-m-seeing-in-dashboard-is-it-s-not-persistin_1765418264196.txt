The issue I'm seeing in dashboard is it's not persisting and not saving data again check the screenshot on my PC attached here  they signup tells them error saving progress or onboarding saved it anyways or something please let's fix it please then start working on my oth
er request too
And also work on all these things I am saying 
And it imports their leads very fast if they don't have any leads also say it  animations sync with leads in real time while importing all kpi cards too that DM hour rating or limiting for email it's for AI in sending outreach not for importing hope you know  animations for email import and Instagram should differ too make AI full to be same in email the backend response adaptive tone intelligence layer everything in app to be same in email and Instagram DM automation replies use the Instagram button to wrap up links for them to feel premium web hook events supports it so use their button the way competitors do too like manychat etc
Don't be offended some page are locked when they signup ornlimda hidden is it the pro features or what conversation please don't be so harsh there and also  hope our AI actually connects their calendly via oauth and web hook we have everything already and if a lead wants to book meeting for our users when they connect calendly it asks  in conversing with them goes to calendly vreate new meeting for them I'm their account and send meeting link like that on email then if on instgram if needed in conversation it wraps it up in a button for them too confirm it's there too

You are a senior full-stack developer + AI prompt engineer. You are tasked with implementing the *Instagram DM Leads Import UI + AI Filtering* for Audnix AI. The goal is to make the flow *fully automated, fast, and visually clear* while keeping plan-based lead limits and ensuring AI filters for real leads. Follow these requirements:

---

# 1. Plan-Based Lead Limits

- Free plan: first 500 DMs  
- $49 plan: first 2,500 DMs  
- $99 plan: first 7,000 DMs  
- $199 plan: first 20,000 DMs  

- UI must display:
    - Number of DMs already imported.  
    - Total lead limit for that plan.  
    - Progress bar or counter showing how many DMs are being imported.  

---

# 2. DM Import Flow

1. User clicks *“Import DMs”*.  
2. AI first fetches *latest DMs* (most recent messages first).  
3. AI reads each conversation *very fast* and filters for quality:
    - Exclude low-effort messages (“hey”, “hi”, emojis only).  
    - Keep messages showing engagement, interest, or buying intent.  
4. AI presents a *button for user acknowledgment*:
    - “I understand AI will read my DMs to filter real leads before importing.”
    - Only after acknowledgment does the AI proceed.  
5. Once confirmed, AI imports filtered DMs up to the plan’s lead limit.  
6. Progress is animated to show work being done (“AI analyzing conversations…”).  
7. At the end, UI shows:
    - Number of DMs imported.  
    - Total plan limit.  
    - Remaining importable DMs.  
8. If fewer real leads exist than plan limit, show the actual number imported.

---

# 3. AI Features

- Reads conversation context to *filter fake or low-quality leads*.  
- Reads only the *latest messages* down to the point where lead becomes irrelevant.  
- Ensures *speed and accuracy*.  
- Animations and progress indicators must reflect real-time work (“AI scanning X DMs…”).  
- Logs imported leads and filtered-out leads for auditing.  

---

# 4. UI/UX Requirements

- Clean, minimal design.  
- Progress bar for import + number of DMs imported / total lead limit.  
- Animated AI “working” effect while scanning conversations.  
- Button for user acknowledgment *before import*.  
- Clear message if fewer leads than limit are found.  
- Works on both desktop and tablet screens.

---

# 5. Backend Requirements

- Fully integrate with Instagram Graph API to fetch DMs.  
- Filter conversations using AI analysis.  
- Respect plan-based lead limits.  
- Log imported leads and skipped conversations.  
- Send data to frontend for real-time updates during import.  

---

# 6. Deliverable

- Fully functional *Instagram DM Leads Importer*.  
- Clean, branded, animated UI.  
- AI accurately filters low-quality leads.  
- Lead counts displayed, progress shown.  
- User acknowledgment handled correctly.  
- Fully integrated with existing Audnix AI backend and webhook APIs.  

---

Generate *React/Next.js frontend + backend endpoints* with fully working AI import logic, plan-based limits, animated progress, acknowledgment button, and conversation filtering. Ensure the AI reads the latest messages first, filters effectively, and logs all actions for auditing. UI must match Audnix AI branding and be production-ready.

Work on all these things please 🥺 manage replit free plan too

some are done check the one not done bro before working
WhatsApp removal incomplete; UI and server start are clean, but backend logic still references WhatsApp. Further cleanup is required in routes, storage, and data import flows to fully remove the feature.


Check what's not done yet before working please and I think cuz of that not saving onboarding data keeps showing company data etc over and over again they couldn't connect Instagram auth was saying user not authenticated or something and in that activated checklist you didn't make task 1 completed by default cuz they must see onboarding before dashboard so yeaa should be marked as default
