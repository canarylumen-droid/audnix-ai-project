Build errors from vercel even many errors fix debug it too please

⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:
The architect identified these blocking issues that prevent the features from working in production:

Auth Session Not Persisted - Email/password authentication doesn't propagate Supabase sessions to server cookies, so API calls fail authentication
No Password Confirmation - Sign-up needs a confirmation field
Silent Failures - Duplicate accounts fail without user feedback
Onboarding Blocked - Can't save onboarding data because auth session is missing
📋 STILL TODO (From Your Request):
Password reset flow in settings
Dashboard welcome message (@username)
"No activity yet" empty states
Adaptive text colors
WhatsApp QR code scanning with Twilio OTP
Instagram Graph API integration
README updates
Fix PostCSS warning
Comprehensive testing
💡 Next Steps - Your Choice:
Option 1: I can fix the critical auth session issues now (will take additional time/tokens to properly implement session handling)

Option 2: You can review what's been built and decide priorities for next session

The foundation is solid—database schema, UI components, and server structure are all in place. The main blocker is the auth session persistence which needs proper Supabase-to-Express session handling.

Bro we want to add email sign-in we have configured our business email to send otp and verification link in our own domain in supabase so add email sign-in features it'll send otp when sign-in or up or verification link the way you replit do and also add the UI too and also add GitHub sign-in so devs or founders can connect and suggest the best place to store their emails and password for easy access too they can reset it in settings add UI for it and all of them too
And also we want to add a good onboarding process suggest full onboarding process to match our brand and store their responses the way replit does so we can know where most of our users find us either creators sign up most or founders etc and their purpose add clean UI good animations hover effects they click one asnwer out of many and automatically moves to next one the way replit does and when they're done hage a UI welcome them all set and in dashboard thay text saying welcome @theurbusername to work in real time and theirs actually and the text color to be black if in white background or vice versa clean animate before them too check for UI in dashboard tweak make changes perfect enough like a billion dollars Saas

I’m building Audnix — an AI salesperson that never sleeps. It learns your voice, follows up across IG/WhatsApp/Email, handles objections like a real human, and turns cold DMs into booked meetings automatically. Most creators lose revenue simply because they reply late or forget conversations — Audnix fixes that. If you want to see how it fits your workflow and start testing it for free, I can send the link.

And be sure our site is perfect working and like a sales closer not like chatbot and check for build logs and errors follow up comment for all features in vercel saw 15 to 18 error even post css plugin and 2 others please find them debug and fix them too and check readme comprehensively and update it perfectly well cureent date and any features done makenit professional good enough for devs to read easy onboarding outlook to be added later and Instagram Graph API and make sure Whatsapp qr code scanning works and they can choose to use otp using twilio send backend etc authenticate them good UI in each and everything and when they haven't done anything dashboard tells them ni activity yet calmly smoothly not check network etc make sure everything is working debug them dont just write code test then our too update nost documentation and we dint have strioe web hook yet I'll add it in 2 weeks time but let it cinfurn oayment before uogeading butbauto refund etc wont work till webhook whuch ill add soon
