            problemTitle="The Churn Trap"
            problemText={`Most agencies stay trapped between $10k and $50k MRR because growth requires headcount. 

Every new client means hiring more SDRs or VAs. SDRs are expensive ($3k-$5k/mo) and prone to inconsistency. VAs often lack the nuance required for high-ticket closing. 

Your payroll swells, but your margins shrink. When a hire makes a mistake or ghosts a lead, your client churns. You're left with a bloated payroll and a shrinking pipeline.

Audnix breaks this cycle. 

By deploying autonomous AI agents, you decouple revenue from headcount. One manager can now oversee 50+ client bots that never sleep, never forget a script, and never have a 'bad day'.`}

            deepDiveText={`Audnix was built for agencies first. Our central dashboard allows you to toggle between 50+ client sub-accounts in seconds.
            
            Each client gets their own isolated 'Brain' (Knowledge Base) and 'Voice' (Style Guide). This means Client A's bot will never talk like Client B's bot.
            
            You can verify ROI with our 'Deterministic Attribution' engine. We track exactly which AI conversation led to a booked meeting or sale, giving you undeniable proof of performance to show your clients.`}
