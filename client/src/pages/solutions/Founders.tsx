            problemText={`Nobody sells better than the Founder. But you can't take every call.

When you take the call, the close rate is 40%. When you hire a rep, it drops to 15%. Hiring is a nightmare: $10k recruiters, $5k bases, and months of training, only for them to burn leads.

Meanwhile, your calendar is full of 'tire kickers' with $0 budget. You spend your precious time doing unpaid consulting for people who can't afford you.

Audnix clones your sales logic—your best objection handlers, your qualification criteria, and your tone. 

The AI agent sits at the front door. It talks to every lead, asks the hard questions about budget and timeline, and ruthlessly filters out the unqualified. It only puts the 'Hell Yes' leads on your calendar.`}
            deepDiveTitle="The Closer Protocol"
            deepDiveText={`We analyzed over 100,000 successful high-ticket sales conversations to build our 'Closer Protocol' logic.
            
            Audnix doesn't just answer questions; it drives the conversation. It uses 'Micro-Agreements', 'Labeling', and 'Mirroring' techniques (from Chris Voss negotiation frameworks) to uncover real pain points.
            
            It will respectfully challenge prospects who say 'it's too expensive' by re-anchoring the conversation to the cost of inaction. It qualifies strictly: if a lead doesn't have the budget, it won't let them book a call.`}

                { question: "Can it really replace a human?", answer: "For the initial qualification and appointment setting phase: Yes, and often better. For the final closing call on a $10k+ offer, you might still want a human, but Audnix ensures that human only talks to qualified buyers." },
                { question: "What CRMs do you integrate with?", answer: "We integrate natively with HubSpot, Salesforce, GoHighLevel, and Slack. We also have a robust Zapier integration." },
                { question: "How much time does it save?", answer: "Founders typically save 20-30 hours a week by removing themselves from the inbox and initial discovery calls." },
