            problemText={`Attention is not revenue. To turn followers into buyers, you need conversation. 

If you have 100k followers, you get 100+ DMs a day. You have two bad choices: 
1. Spend 5 hours replying manually and burn out. 
2. Ignore them and leave thousands of dollars on the table.

Hiring a VA often breaks the trust because they don't know your voice. Fans can tell when they're talking to a script.

Audnix shatters this ceiling by cloning YOU. We train an intelligence model on your transcripts, tweets, and course content. It learns your slang, emojis, and worldview. It replies to every fan instantly, handles objections, and drops your links when the intent is high.`}

            deepDiveText={`Audnix isn't a chatbot. It's an AI clone of your digital persona.
            
            We ingest your YouTube transcripts, past DM history, and course content to build a 'Knowledge Graph' of your worldview.
            
            When a fan asks a question, the AI doesn't just look up an answer. It constructs a response using your vocabulary, your sentence structure, and your specific teaching style. It even knows when to use emojis or when to be serious.
            
            This allows you to scale 'intimacy'—providing a 1-on-1 feeling to millions of followers simultaneously.`}

                { question: "Can I take over the chat?", answer: "Yes. The dashboard allows you to jump into any conversation live. The AI will pause immediately when it detects you typing." },
